Game in Java using Command, Singleton, and Template Method design patterns. Player moves a stick figure to reach a goal with undo/redo and macro commands, while an enemy attempts to stop them. Completed as part of ACS3913 course assignment #3.

Used the Singleton design pattern to read configuration files and logging player actions.
